# Running With Debugging Enabled

I will assume you are using vscode.

Use the launch.json as an example, put in your own file paths and move it to the .vscode folder in root, creating it if it doesn't already exist. You should then be able to run it with debugging by going to "Run and Debug" > "Start Image Viewer".
